Foreword
The first part 0f this book is based on a series 0f classes that Rabbi
Aryeh Kaplan z "l gave t0 a small group 0f students at his home in
Brooklyn, from August 10 t0 November 2, 1981. Thinking o f eventually
developing them int0 a book, Rabbi Kaplan had tl1e classes taped and
transcribed. Such being tl1e origin o f this book, tl1e editor was reluctant to
tamper witl1 tl1e sometimes colloquial style, for it brought vivid memories
0f tl1e author discussing these profound concepts witl1 tl1e unique clarity
and simplicity that characterized him. His frequent smile, tl1e amusing
comments witl1 which he lightened a long and involved example, his
unique use 0f Mashal (analogy) blending his scientific background witl1
his profound knowledge 0f T orah, all bring to mind tl1e attribute
Kabbalists are generally known for: Mesamchey Lev (causing others to
be happy 0f heart).

With tl1e eventual publication 0f these transcripts in mind, Rabbi
Kaplan made lists 0f all tl1e ideas mentioned in each class, and included
these summaries after tl1e corresponding transcript. Needless t0 say, these
lists were invaluable in editing tl1e material for publication. In addition,
Rabbi K aplan's voluminous written works were consulted throughout
tl1e entire editing and annotating process.

Chapter 1: KABBALAH and PR O PH E C Y
What does tl1e word K abbalah mean? It stems from tl1e ro o t K abal,
meaning ''to receive.'' Tl1e term implies that it is a certain kind o f
wisdom that is received.1

Tl1e Mtshnah says that " Moses kibel-rcccived T orah on Sinai
and [subsequently] transm itted it t0 Joshua. Jo sh u a transm itted it to
tl1e Elders. Tl1e Elders transm itted it t0 tl1e Prophets. Tl1e P rophets
transmitted it t0 tl1e Men o f tl1e G reat A ssem bly." 2

Moses was tl1e m aster o f all prophets.3 He understood tl1e T o rah
completely." In this sense his prophetic vision was on tl1e level o f an
open vessel that could always receive m ore.5 Perhaps tl1e secret o f
Moses' receiving was, tl1e more he transm itted, tl1e m ore he was able to
receive. Tl1e Mishnah thus says, " Moses kibe! T o rah " because he was the
paradigm 0f complete and total kabbalah-receptivity t0 tl1e prophetic
experience.6

Tl1e idea 0f K abbalah, then, is t0 become com pletely infused witl1
T orah and t0 connect witl1 it on every possible level.7 W ithout K abbalah,
a person could understand T orah on a num ber o f levels. Tl1e only way
t0 grasp every single nuance 0f T o rah, however, is through tl1e prophetic
wisdom that is contained in Kabbalah.8
